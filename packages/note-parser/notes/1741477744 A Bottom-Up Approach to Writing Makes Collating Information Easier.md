Organizing information in a bottom-up structure allows the act of collating information to be simple and easy across various tasks. A top-down approach would enforce a particular structure on the notes and if that structure doesn't lend itself towards the organization necessary for a given task, that task becomes more difficult. If information is organized in a bottom-up fashion, a structure is not pre-enforced and the information itself gives rise to easily collated information once the task itself becomes self-evident and clear.
